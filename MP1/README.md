3. Submission instructions:
   1. Responses to the manually graded questions for both parts in `MP1-report` in a single PDF file. Make sure to apprpriately tag the PDF with the questions on gradescope. 
   2. Autograded components should be uploaded to the assigment `MP1-code`. Follow the instructions for each autograded component for what should be uploaded. You final submission to the `MP1-code` assigment should contain all components to be autograded for MP1. You should upload the follow files:
    - `lqr_solve.py`: Complete the implementation provided in that file
    - `predictions_test.json`: Test predictions for the 6DOF pose estimation problem.
    - All python files needed to solve the 6DOF pose estimation problem. Please only submit `.py` files, `.ipynb` are not allowed.
   3. We reserve the right to take off points for not following submission instructions.
4. Be careful not to work of a public fork of this repo. Make a *private* clone
to work on your assignment.
